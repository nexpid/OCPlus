## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I get banned if I use OC+?

No! Mario118118 has allowed the usage of enhancement exploits in Obby Creator. Be weary you may get banned if you try to use enhancement exploits on other games like Blockate.

### How can I create my own Addon?

There's a [sweet API](https://github.com/Gabe616/OCPlus/tree/addons#readme) for making Addons just for you! Addons will be implemented in v0.9. As of now, there is no way to submit an Addon for OC+ yet.

### The script doesn’t work!

Check the compatibility table, is your executor not supported? If your executor isn't listed or the executor is marked as untested, help contribute by making an [issue](https://github.com/Gabe616/OCPlus/issues) and we'll add it to the readme.
